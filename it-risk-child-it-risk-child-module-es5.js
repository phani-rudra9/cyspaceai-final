These security measures are available as intrusion\n            detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS), which become part\n            of your network to detect and stop potential incidents.</p> \n            <p>The main purpose of an intrusion prevention system is to identify malicious activity,\n                log information about this activity and attempt to block/stop and report it. We have\n                developed a proven, repeatable methodology for the successful deployment and\n                ongoing management of intrusion prevention security (IPS) devices by:</p>   \n                <ul>\n                    <li>Conducting an architecture review including technical and operational\n                        components to determine the right IPS for your organization</li>\\\n                    <li>Developing a configuration design to ensure that systems are properly\n                        monitored</li>   \n                 <li>Staging the IPS and preloading the configuration</li> \n                 <li>Assisting with the deployment of the IPS</li>\n                 <li>Providing tuning and ongoing management of the IPS and integrating the\n                    IDS/IPS logs to SIEM</li>\n                </ul> \n                <p>Tools- Cisco Fire sight, Security Onion, Suricata, OSSEC</p>          \n</div>\n                    </div>\n -->\n");
